Getting Firefox to accept the ESGF OpenID certificate
=====================================================

CoG uses an ESGF OpenID as its authentication mechanism. The SSL
certificate used by ESGF is self-signed. Some browsers have difficulty
with this certificate and users will need to tell their browser to trust
it.

Every browser has a different mechanism for accepting SSL certificates
it does not trust. Below are the steps for Firefox.

Step 1: Enter your OpenID (or select your OpenID providing using the pulldown) in the login box and click “Login”
