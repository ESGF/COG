Node Home Project Setup
=======================

Each ESGF-CoG node has a “home” project, which is the top-level project
that users are redirected to when they access the Node’s top-level URL.
Typically, the home project describes the Node itself, the institution
hosting the Node, and the main goals/activities of that Node. When an
ESGF Node is installed from scratch, a stub project called “TestProject”
is created and configured as that node home project. You will want to
replace it with a project named more appropriately for your Node,
following the steps below (as you are logged in as Node administrator):

Step 1: Register a new project
------------------------------

-  Click on the “Register a New Project” link (Figure 1) in the upper
   right corner of CoG.
-  You must populate at least the following mandatory fields (all other
   fields can be populated and changed at a later time):

   -  Short Name: choose a short name (no spaces) that is unique for
      your node. Theconvention for ESGF Nodes is to choose a home
      project name of the form “ESGF-XXX” where XXX is a unique name for
      your ESGF Node and institution. Examples: “ESGF-JPL” (for
      https://esg-datanode.jpl.nasa.gov/projects/esgf-jpl/) or
      “ESGF-ESRL” (for https://esgf.esrl.noaa.gov/projects/esgf-esrl/).
      The home project short name is the only attribute of a project
      that can never be changed, since it enters (in lower case form) in
      ALL URLs for that project. If you decide you don’t like the name
      you have chosen, you will have to create a new project, transfer
      all content from the old to the new project, then deleted the old
      project.
   -  Long Name: the project long name will appear as the title of the
      node home page. This can be changed later using the “Update
      Project” link in the left “Administrators” menu. Example:
      “ESGF@NASA/JPL”.
   -  Description: the project description will be used as the initial
      content of the node home page. This can be changed later by
      editing the project home page via the wiki functionality. Example:
      “Welcome to the ESGF Node at NASA/JPL”.

-  When done, click “Submit”.

Step 2: Approve the new project
--------------------------

-  All CoG projects, before being accessible, must be approved by the
   Node Administrator.
-  While you are still logged in as Node Administrator, click on the
   “CoG Admin” link (Figure 2).
-  On the list of projects, locate the project you just created and
   click on the corresponding “Update” link.
-  Check the “Is Active?” checkbox to make the project accessible.
-  Click “Submit”.
-  Optionally, you may want to check “Is Private?” to prevent the
   project from becoming public before if you are satisfied with its
   initial content.

Step 3: Configure the new project as the Node “home” project
------------------------------------------------------------

To make the new project the node home project:

edit: /usr/local/cog/cog_config/cog_settings.cfg change: HOME_PROJECT =
TestProject to: HOME_PROJECT = example: HOME_PROJECT = ESGF-JPL

Since you are editing this file, you may also want to:

-  Choose a new SECRET_KEY (any long, random, unique sequence of
   characters) : a random string is generated when CoG is first
   installed, but you may want to replace it with your own long sequence
   of random characters (any character is allowed).
-  Setup your TIME_ZONE (any valid time zone name supported by the
   Python datetime package - see wikipedia page for full listing).

Step 4: Save the file and restart the ESGF Node.
------------------------------------------------

-  Check that the node top-level URL: https:/// redirects to:
   https:///projects//.

Step 5: Edit the node “home” project “home” page
------------------------------------------------

At this point, you may want to start populating the content of the home
page for your node home project.

For convenience, we have created an example of a generic ESGF Node home
page that you are welcome to use as a starting point - see this ESGF
Node Home Page Example. If you like the example, you can use your
browser to view the HTML source, and cut-and-paste the HTML code
(between the “START ESGF HOME PAGE EXAMPLE” and “END ESGF HOME PAGE
EXAMPLE” lines) into the wiki content of your Node home page. Note that
you will have to manually download the banner image to your desktop, and
upload it to your project using the wiki. Also, the template is
formatted for the “Main Content, Right Widgets” layout (selectable when
you update the page in the wiki). Then, keep using the wiki to further
customize the home page with information specific to your Node.

For help in using the wiki, formatting images etc, there is a list of
web-based tutorials to help you get started.

For live examples of customized ESGF home pages, see the ESGF Node @
NOAA/ESRL and ESGF Node @ NASA/JPL.
