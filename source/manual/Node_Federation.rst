Node Federation
===============

Version 2.4 of CoG introduced the ability to federate projects across
CoG instances. This means that organizations that decide to install
their own CoG instance can share their projects with other instances in
a seamless federation. To enable this feature, the following steps
should be followed:

Step 1: Click on the “Configure Peers” link at the bottom of the left navigation bar (Figure 1)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-  This link is only available to Node Administrators.

Step 4: Click the “Syncronize projects” link (Figure 2)
