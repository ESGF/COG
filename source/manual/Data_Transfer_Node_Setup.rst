Data Transfer Node Setup
========================

Due to increasing size of climatology datasets published recently, a
network link to the data nodes becomes frequently a bottleneck what
forces the ESGF admins to migrate the data nodes to hardware with a
higher bandwidth network link. Taking into account that the hardware
upgrade is not always possible or an upgraded link may become a
bottleneck in the near future, setting up a DTN node
(https://fasterdata.es.net/science-dmz/DTN/) with access to the same
filesystem to do load balancing can be considered as another option.
This page describes all steps needed to install GridFTP server with the
esgsaml authorization callout and configure load balancing by adding the
server to an existing Globus endpoint pointing to the data node. It is
assumed that Linux system installed on the DTN node satisfies the same
requirements as the ESGF data node - it is RHEL 6 or CentOS 6 with the
EPEL software repository configured.

Install Globus Connect Server IO
--------------------------------

.. code:: ipython2
 
    # rpm --import http://www.globus.org/ftppub/globus-connect-server/RPM-GPG-KEY-Globus
    # yum -y install http://toolkit.globus.org/ftppub/globus-connect-server/globus-connect-server-repo-latest.noarch.rpm
    # yum -y install globus-connect-server-io

More information about installing Globus Connect Server can be found at https://www.globus.org/globus-connect-server.

Add the ESGF software repository
--------------------------------

.. code:: ipython2  

  # cat > /etc/yum.repos.d/esgf.repo
  [esgf]
  name=ESGF
  baseurl=http://distrib-coffee.ipsl.jussieu.fr/esgf/RPM/centos/6/x86_64
  failovermethod=priority
  enabled=1
  priority=90
  gpgcheck=0

If the DTN node runs RHEL Linux, replace ‘centos’ with ‘redhat’ in the
path above. You can also copy this file from the data node.

Install ESGF authorization packages
-----------------------------------

.. code:: ipython2

   yum -y install globus-authz-esgsaml-callout globus-gaa globus-adq customgsiauthzinterface

Configure Globus Connect Server IO
----------------------------------


.. code:: ipython2

   Copy /etc/globus-connect-server-esgf.conf from the data node
   [Globus]
   User = %(GLOBUS_USER)s 
   Password = %(GLOBUS_PASSWORD)s 
   [Endpoint] 
   Name =  <short_hostname_of_the_data_node>
   Public = True 
   [Security] 
   FetchCredentialFromRelay = True
   #CertificateFile = /etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem 
   #KeyFile = /etc/grid-security/hostkey.pem 
   TrustedCertificateDirectory = /etc/grid-security/certificates/
   IdentityMethod = MyProxy
   AuthorizationMethod = Gridmap 
   [GridFTP] 
   Server = %(HOSTNAME)s
   IncomingPortRange = 50000,51000
   OutgoingPortRange = 50000,51000
   RestrictPaths = R/,N/etc,N/tmp,N/dev
   Sharing = False
   SharingRestrictPaths = R/ 
   SharingStateDir = /etc/grid-security/sharing/$USER 
   [MyProxy] 
   Server = <FQDN of the IdP node>

To add the GridFTP server to the existing Globus endpoint associated
with the data node, you must use the same Globus username as you used
when running esg-node on the data node and the same endpoint name. The
endpoint name on the data node was picked automatically - it is a short
hostname of the data node. You can also comment out ‘CertificateFile’
and ‘KeyFile’ and let Globus Connect Server setup script to obtain a
certificate and a private key from Globus. After all the changes run:
globus-connect-server-io-setup -v -c
/etc/globus-connect-server-esgf.conf

Add ESGF specific GridfTP configuration
---------------------------------------

GridFTP server on the dat node runs in a chroot jail that is set up at
/esg/gridftp_root. To keep the same configuration consistent with the
data node, you can create the same directory with subdirectories on the
DTN node and bind shared dataset root directories to the subdirectories.
For example: mount –bind /esg/data /esg/gridftp_root/esg_dataroot

Dataset files in /esg/data on your data node may be mounted at a
different directory on the DTN node, so you will have to change
‘/esg/data’ in the command above accordingly. When all dataset root
directories are accessible on the DTN node under /esg/gridftp_root the
same as on the data node, you can copy /etc/gridftp.d/globus-esgf file
from the data node:

.. code:: ipython2 

  #cat > /etc/gridftp.d/globus-esgf
   chroot_path /esg/gridftp_root
   usage_stats_id ESGF2811 
   usage_stats_target usage-stats.globus.org:4810
   acl customgsiauthzinterface
   $GLOBUS_USAGE_DEBUG “MESSAGES,/esg/log/esg-server-usage-gridftp.log”
   $GSI_AUTHZ_CONF “/etc/grid-security/authz_callouts_esgsaml.conf”
   $GLOBUS_GSI_AUTHZ_DEBUG_LEVEL “10” 
   $GLOBUS_GSI_AUTHZ_DEBUG_FILE “/var/log/gridftp-debug.log”

Copy /etc/grid-security/esgsaml_auth.conf from the data node:

.. code:: ipython2

   # cat >/etc/grid-security/esgsaml_auth.conf
   AUTHSERVICE=https:///esg-orp/saml/soap/secure/authorizationService.htm

Because GridFTP server will run in a chroot jail, you have to setup a
chroot environment. The following command will copy CA certificates,
passwd, group, nsswitch.conf and other files required by GridFTP server:

.. code:: ipython2

   # globus-gridftp-server-setup-chroot -r /esg/gridftp_root

And restart GridFTP server: 

.. code:: ipython2

   # service globus-gridftp-server restart

Test
----

Now, you should be able to access datasets through the Globus Web UI
which will do load balancing across the data node and the DTN. When you
go to https://www.globus.org/app/endpoints?scope=my-endpoints, and
select an enpoint associated with the dat node and click the ‘Server’
tab, you should see two GridFTP servers. On the example screenshot,
dev.esgf.anl.gov is the IdP node with MyProxy server (‘Identity
Provider’) and the data node with GridFTP server (‘Servers’).
App007.cels.anl.gov is the DTN node with GridFTP server
(gsiftp://app007.cels.anl.gov:2811):

To see datasets, go to https://www.globus.org/app/transfer and select
your Globus endpoint. Click the ‘Go’ button to be sure that Globus hits
your new DTN GridFTP server when listing the root directory.
